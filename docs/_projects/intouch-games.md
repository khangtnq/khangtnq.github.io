<p style="text-align: center;">Golden Road, my first game at Intouch Game</p>
</div>

What I do: Intouch was specialised at making slot casino games, and every game has a unique bonus round called a "feature" or "mini-game." As a client developer, my main role was to communicate with the production team, artists, animators, and musicians to implement the mini-game feature of said games..

<p style="text-align: center;">Golden Road, which resembles a tile-based board game with dice, is one of the mini-games of the slot games.</p>
